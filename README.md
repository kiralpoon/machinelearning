Machine learning project
=========================
Starter project code for Kiral Poon
------------------------------------
This project will use scikitlearn and try different things

**By running tools/**

	python startup.py
	or
	ipython startup.py

*The program will check if the library installed properly in the python. Since all these library support to python 2.7.

The startup.py will also download a data set called enron_mail_20150507.tgz.

It takes a long time to download it and then it will unzup to the directory called maildir/ . 

I intentionally not include thoese two file and folder to the git because it is too big and have too many folder.
The problem is it will dramatically slow down the git.
