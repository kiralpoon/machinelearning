Machine learning project

Starter project code for Kiral Poon

This project will use scikitlearn and try different things

By running tools/    
python2.6 startup.py

The program will check if the library installed properly in the python. Since all these library support to python 2.6, but the most updated python is not 2.6, so python2.6 will be need to called specifically to compile.
The startup.py will also download a data set called enron_mail_20150507.tgz.
It takes a long time to download it and then it will unzup to the directory called maildir/ . 
I intentionally not include thoese two file and folder to the git because it is too big and have too many folder.
The problem is it will dramatically slow down the git.
